[cfd.xyz](http://cfd.xyz) is an open-source web app to efficiently and easily explore fluid dynamics problems for a wide range of parameters. The framework provides a proof of technology for OpenFOAM tutorials, showing the whole process from the generation of the surrogate models to the web browser. It also includes a standalone web tool for visualizing users' models by directly dragging and dropping the output folder of the ROM offline stage. Beyond the current proof of technology, this enables a collaborative effort for the implementation of OpenFOAM-based surrogate models in applications demanding real-time solutions such as digital twins and other digital transformation technologies.

We aim with the developments presented in this work to create a common place where canonical and industrial CFD problems can be visualized and analyzed without carrying out a simulation, or as a preliminary step for optimizing parameters of new simulations. Having an open-source centralized service has several advantages from educational, optimization and reproducibility point of views. But also from a CO2 footprint perspective.

The web app relies on the [rom.js](https://github.com/simzero-oss/rom-js) module, a JavaScript port of a set of open-source packages (Eigen, Splinter and VTK/C++, ITHACA-FV) to solve the online stage of reduced-order models (ROM) generated by the ITHACA-FV tool. It can also be executed outside a web browser within a backend JavaScript runtime environment, or in a given web solution.


This is a beta version, please handle it with care. Further features, optimizations and fixes are expected. We are also working on including machine learning data-driven methods.

### Requirements

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) 20.10.12
* npm 6.14.11 (optional)

## Installation

You can install and serve `cfd-xyz` in your computer with `npm`:

```
VERSION=v1.0.0-rc.5 make all
```

And use the web by entering `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

Alternatively, you can use the [Docker image](https://github.com/orgs/simzero-oss/packages/container/package/cfd-xyz) for building and serving the web:

```
VERSION=v1.0.0-rc.5 make all-docker
```

The web will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.
